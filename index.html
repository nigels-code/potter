        Handbuilding is an ancient pottery-making technique that mainly focuses
        around pinching, coil building, and slab building. I use all three
        methods in my ceramic work but in my workshops I tend to use coil
        building the most. I find it very therapeutic as it&apos;s using hands,
        fingers and simple tools. To make a pinch pot you would use your thumb
        and put it into a ball of clay and pinch the clay between your thumb and
        fingers while rotating the ball of clay. This thins out the sides and
        raises the height of the pot. Pinching can be very rustic and organic,
        but can also be so unique and personal. Coil building is a forming
        method that uses sausage/ropelike coils of clay, assembled in rings to
        build up the wall of a vessel or pot.
